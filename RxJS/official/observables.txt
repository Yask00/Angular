Observables are lazy Push collections of multiple values.

---Pull versus Push---

Pull and Push are two different protocols that describe how a data Producer 
can communicate with a data Consumer.

RxJS introduces Observables, a new Push system for JavaScript. 
An Observable is a Producer of multiple values, "pushing" them to Observers (Consumers).

-A Function is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns a single value on invocation.
-A generator is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns zero to (potentially) 
    infinite values on iteration.
-A Promise is a computation that may (or may not) eventually return a single value.
-An Observable is a lazily evaluated computation that can synchronously or asynchronously 
    return zero to (potentially) infinite values from the time it's invoked onwards.

---Anatomy of Observables---
1. Creating Observables
2. Subscribing to Observables
3. Executing Observables (next, error, complete)
4. Disposing Observable Executions (unsubscribe)
