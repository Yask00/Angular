----Operators are functions. There are two kinds of operators:----

Pipeable Operators are the kind that can be piped to Observables using 
the syntax observableInstance.pipe(operator()). These include, filter(...), 
and mergeMap(...). When called, they do not change the existing Observable 
instance. Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic 
is based on the first Observable.

Creation Operators are the other kind of operator, which can be called as 
standalone functions to create a new Observable. For example: of(1, 2, 3) 
creates an observable that will emit 1, 2, and 3, one right after another. 
Creation operators will be discussed in more detail in a later section.

---Piping---
Instead of 
    op4()(op3()(op2()(op1()(obs))))
we use
    obs.pipe(
        op1(),
        op2(),
        op3(),
        op3(),
    )

---Creation---
functions that can be used to create an Observable with some common predefined
behavior or by joining other Observables.
