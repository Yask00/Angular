THIS COURSE WILL NOT COVER E2E tests

There are three types of automated testing
    Unit tests
        Done against single unit of code
    End to End tests
        Done against live running app
        Automating the browser (click buttons, type form fields)
    Integration tests (aka Functional)
        More than a unit but less than application
        Make sure that certain part of the application works with another part
        SHALLOW
            testing only one component
        DEEP
            testing the components and child components ect

Mocking
    Important concept in unit testing
    Making sure that we are testing only single unit of code at a time
    User component and User Service
        We dont want to use the real user service
        We want to test the component only
        We need to drawn boundary around the unit === with mocks
    Mock is a class that looks like the real one, but we modify it
    TYPES OF MOCKS
        Dummies - just objects filling space, use on the place of the real one
        Stub - object that has controllable behavior, if we call a 
                method on a stub we can decide what will return
        Spies - object that keeps track of which methods were called (how many times)
                and what parameters were used for each call

Types of Unit test in angular
    Isolated
    Intergration
        In the context of angular module

Tools for angular unit tests
    KARMA - test runner exercising our test in a browser
    JASMINE - Tool to create mocks 
    OTHERS - Jest, Mocha/Chai (Jasmine replacement), Sinon (Mocking library), Wallaby (code coverage)

Structuring Unit test
    AAA pattern
        Arrange all necessary preconditions andi nputs
        Act on the object or class under test
        Assert that the expected results have occured

Shallow integration tests
    TestBed allows us to test together the component and its template
